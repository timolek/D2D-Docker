Data 2 Documents
================

Version 0.2.1 - 30 April 2016

Setup instructions
------------------

1. Place the d2d_system directory somewhere on your web server. This could be in your web root directory, but could also be a directory below that, unreachable for web traffic. 

2. Re-route all requests to the d2d_portal.php script, except for requests targeted directly at specific file extensions. See the example .htaccess file and alter it in according to the location of the d2d_system folder.

This documentation will be extended in the near future. In the meantime, we are happy to help if you have questions. Please send us an email at info@data2documents.org
